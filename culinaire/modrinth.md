Culinaire is an expansion onto the existing foodstuffs in Minecraft with intricate, well-made additions. From the innovative sandwich system to the creation of cheese in cauldrons and the brewing of tea in kettles, this mod is plentiful of mouth-watering food items.

Culinaire requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/), [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and [Dawn API](https://modrinth.com/mod/dawn)
