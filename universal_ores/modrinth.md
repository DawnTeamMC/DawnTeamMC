Universal Ores adds new vanilla ores variants for Andesite, Diorite, Granite and Tuff that generate naturally.

Universal Ores requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/), [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and [Dawn API](https://modrinth.com/mod/dawn)

*Universal Ores is made for Fabric, and there are no current plans to port it to Forge.*
