The Dawn API for Minecraft 1.16 facilitates the creation of features for other mods. It also is bundled with some enchantments and effects used by other mods.

The Dawn API requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

Want to help with the translations of our mods? Check out our [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/dawnteam)!

The Dawn API is made for Fabric, and there are no plans to port it to Forge.
